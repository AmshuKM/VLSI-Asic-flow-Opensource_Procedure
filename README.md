# VLSI-Asic-flow-Opensource_Procedure
Step-by-step documented flow for performing ASIC physical design using OpenROAD in linux. Includes environment setup, floorplanning, placement, routing, and timing closure â€” with verified commands and tool versions.

This is a easy to follow procedure , knowing a basics of linux is recommended.
I recommend maintaining different directories for different designs and also copying the .lib .lef files to a different directory for ease of access.

## Procedure
I recommend you to do the OpenROAD installation and the technology files download first as it is a one time thing.
Then for every design you can follow the asic flow procedure.

If you are confident in using linux , you can use tcl scripts or .ys scripts for yosys as well.
